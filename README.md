# KitchenManager
A simple program to track the inventory of my kitchen

Program will demonstrate CRUD for managing the items in my kitchen. It will include expiration dates, and I will be able to sort items, including by expiration date. I will be able to add items via a guided function, as well as remove them. When these are working, I will add a function to edit them as well. This will be an exercise in CRUD, as well as saving and reading, which is something I historically struggle with. The end product will be a program that makes my life better in a practical way, by reducing my food waste, over-spending, etc.
